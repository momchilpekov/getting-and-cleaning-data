The purpose of the script is to combine two datasets from smart phone accelerometers tests.
Second purpose is to prepare a tidy dataset of the average of the each means and standard deviations.

Project data are downloaded from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

They should be unpacked you working directory and run_analysis.R should be put in the unpacked directory.

We have as a result the "data" data frame, which is the combined dataset and the "tidy.txt", which is a tidy dataset of the means of the variables which are either means or standards deviations. 

Explanation of how script works are included as comments in the run_analysis.R
